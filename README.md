</p>

## What's New in v1.1.49

OpenTypeless now understands more of the workflow around your voice, not only the words you said:

- **App-aware writing** detects the active application locally and adapts structure and tone for email, chat, documents, issue trackers, coding tools, and more.
- **Voice intent routing** distinguishes dictation, selected-text editing, translation, Ask Anything, and supported voice actions in English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.
- **Multiple shortcuts per workflow** let you assign and reorder more than one binding for Dictation, Ask Anything, and Translation.
- **Switchable translation targets** make it faster to move between the languages you use instead of keeping one fixed output language.
- **A stronger local dictionary** adds correction rules plus dictionary import/export, so recurring names, terminology, and transcription mistakes stay under your control.
- **Per-app style mappings** let you override the built-in app category when a detected app needs a different writing style.

All application detection, mappings, dictionary entries, and correction rules are stored locally. App-aware polish sends only the internal app category and approved style metadata to the configured LLM path; raw window titles and document contents are not sent to the LLM or stored in history.

## Ask Anything

Ask Anything is a shortcut-first voice Q&A flow, not a chat tab. Press the Ask Anything hotkey, speak a question, stop recording, and OpenTypeless transcribes it, sends a one-shot request to the LLM, then shows only the final answer in a small floating note.

It is designed for quick answers with no chat history, no input box, and no extra send step. If selected-text context is enabled, Ask can also answer questions about the text currently selected in another app.

Default shortcuts now follow the Typeless-style flow:

| Platform | Dictation | Ask Anything | Translate selected text |
| -------- | --------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| macOS    | `Fn`      | `Fn+Space`   | `Fn+LeftShift`          |
| Windows  | `Right Alt` | `Right Alt+Space` | `Right Alt+LeftShift` |
| Linux    | `Ctrl+/`  | `Ctrl+.`     | configurable            |

Linux keeps conservative Ctrl-based defaults because global Right Alt handling is less reliable across desktop environments, especially on Wayland.

## What OpenTypeless Does

OpenTypeless gives you four voice-first desktop workflows:

| Workflow              | What happens                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dictation             | Hold a hotkey, speak, transcribe, optionally polish with an LLM, then type or copy the result into the active app      |
| Ask Anything          | Start a one-shot voice question, transcribe it, send it to the LLM, and show only the final answer in a small panel    |
| Selected-text editing | Select text in another app, speak an instruction, and let the LLM rewrite, summarize, translate, or fix that selection |
| Translation           | Use a dedicated shortcut, speak or select text, and send the result to one of your configured target languages         |

Use it for emails, chat replies, meeting notes, issue comments, prompts, documentation drafts, quick answers, multilingual translation, and any workflow where speaking is faster than typing.

## Why OpenTypeless?

Most desktop dictation tools stop at transcription. OpenTypeless adds the AI rewrite layer, provider choice, and open-source control that power users need.

## Try It in 5 Minutes

1. Download the latest build for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/tover0314-w/opentypeless/releases).
2. Choose **BYOK** for full provider control or **Cloud** if you want managed quota without API keys.
3. Pick speech recognition and AI polish providers in Settings.
4. Set one or more shortcuts for Dictation, Ask Anything, and Translation.
5. Open any desktop app, press the hotkey, speak, and let OpenTypeless type the polished result.

## Download

Download the latest version for your platform:

**[Download from Releases](https://github.com/tover0314-w/opentypeless/releases)**

| Platform | File                                         |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | `.msi` installer or `.exe` setup             |
| macOS    | Universal `.dmg` for Apple Silicon and Intel |
| Linux    | `.AppImage` / `.deb` / `.rpm`                |

## Installation Notes

Release signing differs by platform while distribution is being improved. Always download from the official [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tover0314-w/opentypeless/releases) page.

### Windows

Windows SmartScreen may show "Windows protected your PC":

1. Click **More info**
2. Click **Run anyway**

If the installer shows a publisher validation warning:

1. Right-click the `.msi` file → **Properties**
2. Check **Unblock** at the bottom → **Apply**
3. Run the installer again

### macOS

macOS builds are Developer ID signed. If Gatekeeper still blocks first launch while notarization/stapling catches up, remove the quarantine attribute:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/OpenTypeless.app
```

Then open the app normally.

### Linux

**Ubuntu/Debian** — install the `.deb` package:

```bash
sudo apt install ./OpenTypeless_x.x.x_amd64.deb
```

**AppImage** — make it executable and run:

```bash
chmod +x OpenTypeless_x.x.x_amd64.AppImage
./OpenTypeless_x.x.x_amd64.AppImage
```

**NVIDIA + Wayland users:** The app auto-detects this configuration and applies a workaround. If it still crashes on startup, run:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 ./OpenTypeless
```

**Wayland users:** global hotkeys and automatic paste are limited by the desktop environment. OpenTypeless shows this in Settings and falls back to tray/app controls or copy-only clipboard output where needed.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable toolchain)
- Platform-specific dependencies for Tauri: see [Tauri Prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run tauri dev

# Build for production
npm run tauri build
```

The built application will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## Configuration

All settings are accessible from the in-app Settings panel:

- **Speech Recognition** — choose STT provider and enter your API key
- **AI Polish** — choose an LLM provider and model, enable app-aware writing, manage per-app style mappings, and configure selected-text context
- **General** — manage multiple Dictation, Ask Anything, and Translation shortcuts, output mode, auto-start, and idle capsule visibility
- **Dictionary** — add or import custom terms, export your dictionary, and create local correction rules for recurring transcription mistakes
- **Scenes** — built-in and local prompt templates with import/export for reusable writing styles
- **Account / Upgrade** — sign in, check cloud words, manage Pro or Lifetime Starter access

API keys are stored locally in the OS credential vault where available, with a local fallback for unsupported environments. No BYOK keys are sent to OpenTypeless servers — STT/LLM requests go directly to the provider you configure.

### Cloud Option

OpenTypeless also offers optional managed cloud access so you do not need your own provider keys. Pro and Lifetime Starter plans include shared cloud words for speech recognition and AI rewriting. BYOK remains fully supported.

[Learn more about Pro](https://www.opentypeless.com)

### BYOK vs Cloud

|                  | BYOK Mode                                        | Cloud (Pro) Mode                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| STT              | Your own API key or local endpoint               | Managed cloud words                         |
| LLM              | Your own API key or local endpoint               | Managed cloud words                         |
| Cloud dependency | None — all requests go directly to your provider | Requires connection to www.opentypeless.com |
| Cost             | Pay your provider directly                       | Optional Pro or Lifetime Starter            |

All core features — recording, transcription, AI polish, keyboard/clipboard output, dictionary, history — work entirely offline from OpenTypeless servers in BYOK mode.

### Self-Hosting / No Cloud

To run OpenTypeless without any cloud dependency:

1. Choose any non-Cloud STT and LLM provider in Settings
2. Enter your own API keys
3. That's it — no account or internet connection to www.opentypeless.com is needed

If you want to point the optional cloud features at your own backend, set these environment variables before building:

| Variable            | Default                        | Description                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | `https://www.opentypeless.com` | Frontend cloud API base URL     |
| `API_BASE_URL`      | `https://www.opentypeless.com` | Rust backend cloud API base URL |

```bash
# Example: build with a custom backend
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://my-server.example.com API_BASE_URL=https://my-server.example.com npm run tauri build
```

## FAQ

**Is my audio sent to the cloud?**
In BYOK mode, audio goes directly to your chosen STT provider or local endpoint. Nothing passes through OpenTypeless servers. In Cloud mode, audio is sent to the managed proxy for transcription and quota accounting.

**Can I use it offline?**
With a local Whisper-compatible STT endpoint and a local OpenAI-compatible LLM such as Ollama, the app can run without OpenTypeless cloud services.

**Which languages are supported?**
STT supports 99+ languages depending on the provider. AI polish and translation support 20+ target languages.

**Is the app free?**
Yes. The app is fully functional with your own API keys (BYOK). Cloud plans are optional.
