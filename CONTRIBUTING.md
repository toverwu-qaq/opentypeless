# Contributing to OpenTypeless

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers everything you need to get started.

## Development Setup

1. Install prerequisites: Node.js 20+, Rust stable toolchain, and [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)
2. Clone the repo and run `npm install`
3. Start development: `npm run tauri dev`

## How to Contribute

| Type | Process |
|------|---------|
| Bug fix / small improvement | Open a PR directly |
| New feature / architecture change | Start a [Discussion](https://github.com/tover0314-w/opentypeless/discussions/categories/ideas) first |
| Question / help | Post in [Q&A Discussions](https://github.com/tover0314-w/opentypeless/discussions/categories/q-a) |

## Making Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`
3. Make your changes
4. Run the pre-submit checklist (see below)
5. Commit with a descriptive message following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
6. Open a pull request against `main`

## Pre-Submit Checklist

Run these checks before opening a PR:

```bash
# Frontend
npx tsc --noEmit
npx eslint src/
npx prettier --check src/
npx vitest run

# Rust
cargo fmt --check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- -D warnings
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
```

## Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`

Examples:
- `feat: add Groq Whisper STT provider`
- `fix: resolve audio recording crash on macOS`
- `docs: update README installation steps`

## Code Style

- **TypeScript**: strict mode, no `any` types
- **Rust**: `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` must pass
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS for styling, Zustand for state
- **Formatting**: Prettier for TypeScript/JavaScript/CSS

## AI-Assisted Contributions

We welcome contributions made with the help of AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.). If your PR was substantially generated by AI, please mention it in the PR description. The same quality standards apply to all contributions regardless of how they were written.

## Current Priorities

- Stability and reliability across all platforms
- User experience improvements
- Additional STT and LLM provider integrations
- Internationalization coverage

See [VISION.md](VISION.md) for the project's long-term direction.
